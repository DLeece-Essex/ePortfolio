												<h3>Collaborative Discussion One</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												My discussion post was entitled "Increasing cyber security investment in the energy industry". 
												Peer review was provided by two class members.</p>

											<p>The discussion topic, “Increasing cyber security investment in the energy industry”, was intended to highlight
											the need for ICS cyber security investment due to the potential for societal impact. Peer reviewer Steven Johnson 
											contributed very qualified feedback, confirming the lack of military assistance, and identifying solutions offered by CISA.</p>
											<p>The current CISA offerings are related to cyber security response preparedness, risk assessment and specialist assistance when incident response is required (CISA.gov, 2021). While such offerings will accelerate an organization’s ICS cyber security program, the government agency stops short of supporting solution implementation.</p>
											<p>Response capabilities are the fourth of five high level functions defined in the NIST Cyber Security Framework (CSF), asset identification and protection being the first two (NIST, 2020).  NIST CSF states functions do need to be applied in a particular order; that said, certain activity categories are effectively prerequisite to completing other functions.  For example, identifying assets, communication flows and known vulnerabilities within an ICS system is required before an accurate risk assessment can be completed.</p>
											<p>Although CISA provides free information and software (CISA.gov, 2021), the expertise required to collect and analyze the organization’s ICS environment is an expense borne by the ICS operator.  An in-depth legal paper on cyber security investment incentives, cited by peer reviewer Shota Kameyama, noted only larger companies are likely to have dedicated cyber security staff due to cost (Kosseff, 2016). Reviewing tax credit research has identified long term job creation is not assured because tax credits often disappear with policy changes (Bowden, 2013). Retraining grants would allow ICS operators to retain employees with years of field experience and meet the demand for cyber skills without competing in the open market for talent (Maurer & Nelson, 2020) while simultaneously advancing competitiveness through increased digitization. Grant costs may be justifiable when weighed against the social impact of insecure critical infrastructure.</p>

												<h3>Reflections on Collaborative discussion one</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Most of the roles I have held within cyber security have required both technical and written work, 
												therefore the inital prospect of writing discussion topic did not seem daunting. The personal challenge
												I observed was the requirement to find suitable research related to the discussion and being willing to
												search for alternative points of view. Many years as a professional services consultant had familiarized me
												with the peer review process, it is a standard practice before documents are provided to a client. 
												The commercial peer review process is more focused on completion of deliverable artifacts defined in the contract and 
												ensuring statements within the reports will not bring expose the professional services company to liability.</p>
												<p>The peer review process within the assignment was different because my fellow students did not hesitate to bring
													other points forward for my consideration. In particular, the question regarding the effectiveness of tax credits
													forced me to not only research the topic specifically looking for measures of effectiveness but also consider alternative
													approaches to solve the workforce skills issue I still contend requires much more investment. 
												</p>
												<p> At no time did I feel a personal attack, rather I felt this was civil discourse regarding an area of study few people I know
													find the slightest bit interesting. I am looking forward to many more such discussions.

												<h3>Collaborative Discussion Two</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												My discussion post was entitled "Moving beyond firewalls". 
												Peer review was provided by three class members.
											</p>
											<p>
												The first sentence of the original post underscored the need to prioritize security technology investments that protect the user’s account and computing platform since many workers are not always protected by the corporate firewall. The pandemic driven requirement for remote working at scale proved not only feasibility, it also identified cost saving options (Gartner, 2020) and many workers actually prefer it (McCabe, 2020). 
											</p>
											<p>
												Authentication is often the first control that must be satisfied before granting access to any information technology system. Consequently I initially recommended, and still maintain, enhancing this protection mechanism reduces the risk of unauthorized access to an organization’s applications and data in a cost-effective manner. This claim is further supported by additional research I was able to locate separate studies by Microsoft and Google, both reporting greater than 99% reduction in account compromises once multi-factor authentication (MFA) is implemented (Maynes, 2019; Thomas & Moscicki, 2019). Post reviewer Nasim Akbary correctly identified MFA can be implemented through various technologies (Akbary, 2021), raising a question about two common MFA implementations over cellular phone which has both security and economic aspects for consideration.
											</p>
											<p>
												Although mobile access is nearly ubiquitous across the globe, smartphone adoption still lags conventional mobile penetration (PEW Research Center, 2021)  so organizational goals should dictate the MFA choice. One-time codes delivered to a user via short messaging service (SMS) are less convenient than a smartphone application but allow a wider number of users to safely authenticate. When an organization can be assured authorized users will have access to smartphone technology MFA notification applications are more convenient and provide a slight increase in prevention against targeted attacks (Thomas & Moscicki, 2019).
											</p>
											<p>
												Multiple commercial software as a service (SaaS) options are now available to reduce cost and complexity of implementing MFA, placing this technology within the reach of small and medium organizations (Cisco, 2021). Conversely a top tier endpoint detection and response (EDR) product such as Crowdstrike can easily exceed several hundred thousand dollars for a larger organization (Cybersecurity Pricing, 2021), therefore it is not a solution every organization will be able to fund. The high cost of EDR was the impetus for recommending a reduction in network firewall investment as cost balancing measure. The original post did not clarify investment reduction should come through purchasing only firewall capabilities that are needed (Kelley, 2014), not a recommendation for removing firewalls altogether.

												<h3>Reflections on collaborative discussion two</h3>
											</header>
											<p>I did not feel the same level of of engaged discussion with my cohort
												on the second collaborative discussion. The assignment had listed firewalls
												as a possible technology and the class had recently covered firewalls so perhaps there
												was a bias at play. I recieved only one question on my position regarding multifactor 
												authentication and endpoint and detection response agents being much more important
												than firewalls for securing an enterprise in 2021. </p>
											<p>
												I would have welcomed some additional debate in case I have missed a key point. While 
												network protection will always be a manadatory requirement the inability to reliably 
												inspect application layer attacks due to TLS encryption and the amazing levels of 
												obfuscation present in modern fileless malware I am still unconvinced that firewall
												investment should remain the priority. I now consider network based prevention 
												table stakes, not a cornerstone of the defence strategy.

												<h3>Additional Reflection on Module One Components</h3>
											</header>
											<h3>Web Information Threat Modeling</h3>
											<p>I have been helped implement, provided operational support for, and performed technical vulnerability testing on many HTTP applications over the past 20 years. I have also been an incident responder for many HTTP application attacks against organizational systems. My personal observation is most organizations I have worked with do not perform in-depth threat modeling of applications despite these applications being exposed to the internet. </p>
											<p>While organizations may choose not to pursue threat modeling as a preliminary development step the concepts are mature and freely available. The NIST Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF) defines the steps a software producer should take to ensure security is included in the development process and is abstracted enough that it can be applied to popular development models like agile and waterfall while simultaneously being suitable for software created for any industry (NIST, 2020). The NIST SSDF lists threat modeling as a requirement for an organization to produce well-secured software, stopping short of defining a specific approach, links to more detailed resources are included (NIST, 2020).</p>
											<p>The Open Web Application Standard Project (OWASP) has been promoting secure code development for HTTP based applications for more than fifteen years. Similar to other threat modeling guidance it is incumbent on the organization creating the application to identify high impact, high likelihood events that warrant mitigation (OWASP, n.d.).</p>
											<p>Table-top discussions can be used to validate the viability of certain types of threat scenarios (Veatch, et al., 1999) , which can ensure those that know the organization best can best assess the likelihood of a specific threat having an impact on the organization. Table-tops that are focused on organizational impacts can include members of the organization outside of the I.T. department such as legal, plant operations and finance.  Scenario based threat model development is dependent on the input of domain experts, limiting the view of risks to purely technical elements can result in mitigations implemented that have little value and other risks being overlooked.</p>
											<p>Attack trees or threat trees are another approach to identifying threats, while more technical in nature due to the requirement to deconstruct the adversarial goal into a series of steps the path variations can result in hundreds of scenarios for consideration (Widel, et al., 2019). Like table-tops, an attack tree based threat modeling activity will depend on individuals to identify likelihood and impact.</p>
											<p>The OWASP testing guide is the most methodical approach I have personally used to ensure comprehensive testing but there is still a scope negotiaion with the customer prior to testing.</p>

											<h3>Reflection on Individual Essay</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Writing assignments are expected in university, what I was not prepared for was the level of
											ambiguity within the instructions. Fortunately there was an opportunity to present an outline
											of the report and receive email feedback prior to completing the work. I personally found I required
											an office hours meeting with my professor to fully clarify what was required, the emailed responses
											did not really clear up the confusion the way a short conversation did. This experience is not unlike cyber security consulting in the real world, statements of work and requests for
											poposals are often open ended and negotiation regarding final project deliverables is not uncommon.
											</p>
											<p>Writing the report took far more time than the nine hours indicated as recommended study hours and the 2000
												word constraint really limited the level of description possilbe for a solution report. That said, the limitation
												does force the cyber security person to be very selective in what is communicated to the customer. This is not
												an unreasonable requirement, from my experience in the field lengthy reports are seldom read. The challange I have observed,
												again personal experience only, shorter reports with summary tables and high level descriptions lack the detailed analysis
												needed to define requirements for remediation of cyber security issues. </p>
											<p>
												I anticipate I will need to continue to refine my communication skills through writing assignments in later modules.

											<h3>Programing assignment relection</h3>

										<p>The final summative assignment of this module was to write a Python program demonstrating solution recomended 
											by the report submitted for unit 9. During office hours with my professor I was encouraged to include a number
											of security controls, not just one. The programing itself was not difficult, capturing a way to demonstrate
											how the controls were being applied required some creativity. </p>
										<p> Technical reports covering testing plans and results are part of work I have done in the past and it was
											encourgaing to have the professor specify that good testing reports would include screen shots and detailed
