								<p>The Information Risk Management module provided an introduction to information risk management through simulating a risk assessment for an 
									organization implementing an enterprise resource managment solution. The module also included a tangential concept, managing information
									risk management within the traditional software development life cycle. Unfortunately, exploration of this concept was complicated
									by the tutor's limited capacity to explain the material in a meaningful way and the very compressed time line for the summative deliverables.

									The content included below is intended to chronicle the assignment work submitted by Doug Leece

										<h2>Collaborative Learning - Discussion One</h2>
									</header>
									<p>The discussion focused on user involvement in security control development, which I fully support as I believe effective security risk management
										requires a business context (Leece,2021), something often overlooked by those focused on compliance or technology. During the response
										period I located an academic paper on expert judgement which captured the often made assumption that expertise in one area 
										automatically translates to proficeincy in others. <br>
										Unfortunately,only the tutor responded to my posting as others in the cohort were also attempting a second six week compressed module at
										the same time and had limited time to participate.

											<p>
												The first of two summative deliverables, the project team had to create a report justifying the 
												recomended path forward for implementing a ERP soltion for a small manufacturer. A second requirement, 
												identifying the risk management approach to be taken, resulted in clarification with the tutor that
												this project was primarily about enterprise risk management rather than a specific cyber risk. 
												Consequently, Open Fair with input from NIST C.S.F and 800-52 were proposed.

											<p> My research into this discussion located multiple research papers identifying poor requirements gathering 
												as the biggest risk to the software development life cycle. This was not surprising as it aligned with my
												observations as an active participant in I.T. projects for more than twenty years. I was pleasantly surprised 
												to find there have been research projects to address this known issue, one called Gherkin (de Meerendre,2020) 
												attempts to solve the gap between very abstract UML use cases or agile user stories and software feature acceptance testing.

												<h3>Final Project Report</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												The second of two summative deliverables, the project team highlighted the cost benefit 
												analysis supporting the choice of a COTS ERP solution instead of standing up in-house development.
												The risk assessment based on Open FAIR ultilized PERT to generate data input values when quantitiative 
												data was not availiable from the assignment case details. The assignment had one outlying requirement, develop 
												a disaster recovery plan. Although this type of deliverable is normally part of system architecture or solution 
												design rather than enterprise risk assessments the team was able to articulate a warm standby solution 
												enabling ERP continuity in less than 24 hours for less than $50,000.00 annually.

												<h3>Reflections on Module Deliverables</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The tone of the reflection is somewhat negative, primarily owing to the disproportionate amount of work
												I personally had to complete because the remaining three team members were also attempting to complete
												a second 6 week module at the same time. Essex has since discontinued that practice due to many student 
												complaints. That said even with well thought out cirriculumn time tables, the reflection cites several studies 
												of academic group work reporting similar disparity in effort between course participants. <br>
												Although the intention of group projects may be to familiarize those outside of the industry with 
												common I.T. delivery practices, the focus on student success does not align with modern employment practices
												expecting fast ramp-up and quick termination for non-performance.

												<h3>Additional Reflection on Module One Components</h3>
											</header>
											<h3>Web Information Threat Modeling</h3>
											<p>I have been helped implement, provided operational support for, and performed technical vulnerability testing on many HTTP applications over the past 20 years. I have also been an incident responder for many HTTP application attacks against organizational systems. My personal observation is most organizations I have worked with do not perform in-depth threat modeling of applications despite these applications being exposed to the internet. </p>
											<p>While organizations may choose not to pursue threat modeling as a preliminary development step the concepts are mature and freely available. The NIST Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF) defines the steps a software producer should take to ensure security is included in the development process and is abstracted enough that it can be applied to popular development models like agile and waterfall while simultaneously being suitable for software created for any industry (NIST, 2020). The NIST SSDF lists threat modeling as a requirement for an organization to produce well-secured software, stopping short of defining a specific approach, links to more detailed resources are included (NIST, 2020).</p>
											<p>The Open Web Application Standard Project (OWASP) has been promoting secure code development for HTTP based applications for more than fifteen years. Similar to other threat modeling guidance it is incumbent on the organization creating the application to identify high impact, high likelihood events that warrant mitigation (OWASP, n.d.).</p>
											<p>Table-top discussions can be used to validate the viability of certain types of threat scenarios (Veatch, et al., 1999) , which can ensure those that know the organization best can best assess the likelihood of a specific threat having an impact on the organization. Table-tops that are focused on organizational impacts can include members of the organization outside of the I.T. department such as legal, plant operations and finance.  Scenario based threat model development is dependent on the input of domain experts, limiting the view of risks to purely technical elements can result in mitigations implemented that have little value and other risks being overlooked.</p>
											<p>Attack trees or threat trees are another approach to identifying threats, while more technical in nature due to the requirement to deconstruct the adversarial goal into a series of steps the path variations can result in hundreds of scenarios for consideration (Widel, et al., 2019). Like table-tops, an attack tree based threat modeling activity will depend on individuals to identify likelihood and impact.</p>
											<p>The OWASP testing guide is the most methodical approach I have personally used to ensure comprehensive testing but there is still a scope negotiaion with the customer prior to testing.</p>

											<h3>Programing assignment relection</h3>
										</header>
										<p>The final summative assignment of this module was to write a Python program demonstrating solution recomended 
											by the report submitted for unit 9. During office hours with my professor I was encouraged to include a number
											of security controls, not just one. The programing itself was not difficult, capturing a way to demonstrate
											how the controls were being applied required some creativity. </p>
										<p> Technical reports covering testing plans and results are part of work I have done in the past and it was
											encourgaing to have the professor specify that good testing reports would include screen shots and detailed
											explanations. I plan to continue development of this project beyond this class as I think it will help 
											those unfamiliar with security controls to gain a better understanding of how they support application reslience.
