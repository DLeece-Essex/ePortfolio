								<p>The Information Risk Management module provided an introduction to information risk management through simulating a risk assessment for an 
									organization implementing an enterprise resource managment solution. The module also included a tangential concept, managing information
									risk management within the traditional software development life cycle. Unfortunately, exploration of this concept was complicated
									by the tutor's limited capacity to explain the material in a meaningful way and the very compressed time line for the summative deliverables.
									<br />
									The content included below is intended to chronicle the assignment work submitted by Doug Leece
									as well as providing a platform for posting personal reflections on the process.</p>

									<p>
										Learning outcomes stated at the outset of the module, (listed below), were not specifically traceable to the assignment criteria as a one for one match, 
										rather the intention was to interprete assignments and provide a point of view, which may require the e-portfolio reader to be somewhat
										familiar with computer science and cyber security matters.
										</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Identify IT system risks and identify methodologies and technology approaches to mitigate them</li>
											<li>Critically analyse potential solutions and justify selection based on criteria such as organizational fit or cost/benefit</li>
											<li>Participate in a simulated development team environment</li>
										</ul>


									<p>The discussion focused on user involvement in security control development, which I fully support as I believe effective security risk management
										requires a business context (Leece,2021), something often overlooked by those focused on compliance or technology. During the response
										period I located an academic paper on expert judgement which captured the often made assumption that expertise in one area 
										automatically translates to proficeincy in others. <br>
										Unfortunately,only the tutor responded to my posting as others in the cohort were also attempting a second six week compressed module at
										the same time and had limited time to participate.

												<h3>Inital Project Status</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												The first of two summative deliverables, the project team had to create a report justifying the 
												recomended path forward for implementing a ERP soltion for a small manufacturer. A second requirement, 
												identifying the risk management approach to be taken, resulted in clarification with the tutor that
												this project was primarily about enterprise risk management rather than a specific cyber risk. 
												Consequently, Open Fair with input from NIST C.S.F and 800-52 were proposed.

												<h3>Collaborative Discussion Two</h3>
											</header>
											<p> My research into this discussion located multiple research papers identifying poor requirements gathering 
												as the biggest risk to the software development life cycle. This was not surprising as it aligned with my
												observations as an active participant in I.T. projects for more than twenty years. I was pleasantly surprised 
												to find there have been research projects to address this known issue, one called Gherkin (de Meerendre,2020) 
												attempts to solve the gap between very abstract UML use cases or agile user stories and software feature acceptance testing.

												<h3>Final Project Report</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												The second of two summative deliverables, the project team highlighted the cost benefit 
												analysis supporting the choice of a COTS ERP solution instead of standing up in-house development.
												The risk assessment based on Open FAIR ultilized PERT to generate data input values when quantitiative 
												data was not availiable from the assignment case details. The assignment had one outlying requirement, develop 
												a disaster recovery plan. Although this type of deliverable is normally part of system architecture or solution 
												design rather than enterprise risk assessments the team was able to articulate a warm standby solution 
												enabling ERP continuity in less than 24 hours for less than $50,000.00 annually.

												<h3>Reflections on Module Deliverables</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The tone of the reflection is somewhat negative, primarily owing to the disproportionate amount of work
												I personally had to complete because the remaining three team members were also attempting to complete
												a second 6 week module at the same time. Essex has since discontinued that practice due to many student 
												complaints. That said even with well thought out cirriculumn time tables, the reflection cites several studies 
												of academic group work reporting similar disparity in effort between course participants. <br>
												Although the intention of group projects may be to familiarize those outside of the industry with 
												common I.T. delivery practices, the focus on student success does not align with modern employment practices
												expecting fast ramp-up and quick termination for non-performance.
