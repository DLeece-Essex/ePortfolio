												<h3>Literature Review Outline</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Class participants were encouraged to submit a draft of the litereature review for formative feedback. 
												as some students find the format unfamiliar and formative feedback support correction prior to summative submission, 
												often resulting in a better mark. <br>
												Two feed back items stood out, "avoid the introduction of new ideas in the conclusion section" 
												and "do not segment with multiple headings and sub-sections as the report is quiet short." 
												This direction was counter to numerous criticisms received from previous Essex instructors, 
												requesting more "markers" aid reader navigation despite those reports being shorter.
												</p>
											<p>Formative feedback was incorporated into the final submission along with almost 50% more research into the subject,
												finding the best sources to tie the five identified areas of review into a more cohesive narrative. A review of the draft and final submission will show this extensive rework.

												<h3>Collaborative learning discussion two</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Discussion two was further exploration of ethics, this case study focused on the presentation of
												privately funded research. Similar to discussion one, my inital position was ethics are a personal
												matter, and my advice to the researcher would be to present a report that would stand up to scientific
												peer scrutiny and clearly identify the private funding source. The advise given knowing individual 
												scientists often do not experience negative consequences for questionable research and the company would
												likely spin the results to their own benefit or bury the study.</p>
											<p>
												Both respondents to my post echoed concerns with privately funded research and discomfort with the lack
												of ability to prevent skewed research from becomging widely publicized. My summary post is an evolution 
												of the ethics problem versus a postion change. Further research identified questionable research practices
												are quite common and may well be unknowingly committed. Our job as cyber security professionals should 
												include maintaining a skeptical view of commercial solutions claimed to be backed by scinetific research. 
												Academia can not provide guardrails on cyber security research, it would be naive to presume independant 
												researchers or limited government funding could compete with the research and development levels of 
												billion dollar security companies. Therefore, those responsible for implementing solutions must validate
												solution effectiveness by pushing vendors to demonstrate the value in the organization's environement or 
												track success so the right decision is made at product renewal time.

											<h3>Statistical Analysis</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Statistical analysis is often key to the research process, consequently a business statistics textbook was assigned reading 
											and two sets of workbook based assignments were provided to give students practical experience using spreadsheet functions
											to generate statistical artefacts such as standard deviation, and two tailed analysis. <br>
											The professor stated up front the module is not a comprehensive statistics class, which became a factor in the hands-on assigment.
											Running the formulas was straightforward, but I had no confidence in my interpretation what-so-ever, despite attempting the recomended 
											reading and reviewing several additional statistics tutorials online. </p>

										<p>
											Although there is technically tutor support available, this isn't the module's focus and it typically takes 
											several days to work through foundational understanding via email so this wasn't pursued. <br>
											Both unit worksheets are included below along with the Excel workbooks used to process the data.

											<h3>Capstone Project Proposal</h3>
										</header>
											<p>The project proposal provides a means for stakeholders to assess the viability and value of a project.
												Although this is an academic setting, it closely mirrors the regularly undertaken industry process of
												determining the merits of a project before allocating resources. <br>
												Success criteria for academic projects, I.E., a level of contribution to existing knowledge, differ
												from commercial projects which are almost soley focused on improving profitability, knowledge advancement
												is seldom relevant unless the knowledge itself can be turned into a competitive advantage.
