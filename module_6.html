										Learning outcomes stated at the outset of the module, (listed below), were not specifically traceable to the assignment criteria as a one for one match,

										familiar with computer science and cyber security matters.
										</p>

											<li>Understand and perform research based on the scientific method</li>

											<p>Students were asked to review a numer of case studies pertaining to the ACM code of ethics.

												any academic or legal evidence that such a code will serve as a reasonable deterent to someone

												<h3>Collaborative learning discussion two</h3>
												
											</header>
											<p>Discussion two was further exploration of ethics, this case study focused on the presentation of
												privately funded research, both respondents to my post echoed concerns with privately funded research and discomfort with the lack
												of ability to prevent skewed research from becomging widely publicized. Summary post research
												identified questionable research practices are quite common and may well be unknowingly committed. 
												Therefore, I beleive our job as cyber security professionals should 
												include maintaining a skeptical view of commercial solutions claimed to be backed by scientific research. 
												Pushing vendors to demonstrate solution effectiveness in the organization's environement through proof
												of value engagements or track success so the right decision is made at product renewal time.

												<h3>Tutor Feedback: Literature Review & Project proposal</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Without a doubt comming to understand the literature review process and it's importance to academic research
												was the most meaningful part of this module, despite being incredibly challenging. The summative review
												confirms the challenge was ultimately met although it forced rethinking of the capstone project. <br>
												The project proposal provides a means for stakeholders to assess the viability and value of a project.
												Although this is an academic setting, it closely mirrors the regularly undertaken industry process of
												determining the merits of a project before allocating resources.

											<h3>Statistical Analysis</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Statistical analysis is often key to the research process, consequently a business statistics textbook was assigned reading 
											and two sets of workbook based assignments were provided to give students practical experience using spreadsheet functions
											to generate statistical artefacts such as standard deviation, and two tailed analysis. <br>
											The professor stated up front the module is not a comprehensive statistics class, which became a factor in the hands-on assigment.
											Running the formulas was straightforward, but I had no confidence in my interpretation what-so-ever, despite attempting the recomended 
											reading and reviewing several additional statistics tutorials online. </p>

										<p>
											Although there is technically tutor support available, this isn't the module's focus and it typically takes 
											several days to work through foundational understanding via email so this wasn't pursued. <br>
											Both unit worksheets are included below along with the Excel workbooks used to process the data.
