									<p>The assignment took the form of each student creating a discussion board post on the topic of cyber security investment. Students were given lattitude with how the investment
										should be justified but the postion had to be supported by research.</p>

										My discussion post was entitld "Increasing cyber security investment in the energy industry".

												<h3>Collaborative Discussion One</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The discussion topic, “Increasing cyber security investment in the energy industry”, was intended to highlight
											the need for ICS cyber security investment due to the potential for societal impact. Peer reviewer Steven Johnson 
											contributed very qualified feedback, confirming the lack of military assistance, and identifying solutions offered by CISA.</p>
											<p>The current CISA offerings are related to cyber security response preparedness, risk assessment and specialist assistance when incident response is required (CISA.gov, 2021). While such offerings will accelerate an organization’s ICS cyber security program, the government agency stops short of supporting solution implementation.</p>
											<p>Response capabilities are the fourth of five high level functions defined in the NIST Cyber Security Framework (CSF), asset identification and protection being the first two (NIST, 2020).  NIST CSF states functions do need to be applied in a particular order; that said, certain activity categories are effectively prerequisite to completing other functions.  For example, identifying assets, communication flows and known vulnerabilities within an ICS system is required before an accurate risk assessment can be completed.</p>
											<p>Although CISA provides free information and software (CISA.gov, 2021), the expertise required to collect and analyze the organization’s ICS environment is an expense borne by the ICS operator.  An in-depth legal paper on cyber security investment incentives, cited by peer reviewer Shota Kameyama, noted only larger companies are likely to have dedicated cyber security staff due to cost (Kosseff, 2016). Reviewing tax credit research has identified long term job creation is not assured because tax credits often disappear with policy changes (Bowden, 2013). Retraining grants would allow ICS operators to retain employees with years of field experience and meet the demand for cyber skills without competing in the open market for talent (Maurer & Nelson, 2020) while simultaneously advancing competitiveness through increased digitization. Grant costs may be justifiable when weighed against the social impact of insecure critical infrastructure.</p>

												<h3>Reflections on Collaborative discussion one</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Most of the roles I have held within cyber security have required both technical and written work, 
												therefore the inital prospect of writing discussion topic did not seem daunting. The personal challenge
												I observed was the requirement to find suitable research related to the discussion and being willing to
												search for alternative points of view. Many years as a professional services consultant had familiarized me
												with the peer review process, it is a standard practice before documents are provided to a client. 
												The commercial peer review process is more focused on completion of deliverable artifacts defined in the contract and 
												ensuring statements within the reports will not bring expose the professional services company to liability.</p>
												<p>The peer review process within the assignment was different because my fellow students did not hesitate to bring
													other points forward for my consideration. In particular, the question regarding the effectiveness of tax credits
													forced me to not only research the topic specifically looking for measures of effectiveness but also consider alternative
													approaches to solve the workforce skills issue I still contend requires much more investment. 
												</p>
												<p> At no time did I feel a personal attack, rather I felt this was civil discourse regarding an area of study few people I know
													find the slightest bit interesting. I am looking forward to many more such discussions.
