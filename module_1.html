												<h2>Collaborative Learning - Discussions One and Two</h2>
											</header>
											<p>Both assignments took the form of each student creating a discussion board post on topic within the specified cyber security context. Students were given lattitude within the context,presumably
												to generate a variety of discussion topics while retaining a focused theme. All inital positions, discussion posts to cohort peers and 
												summary posts defending or adjusting one's position would need to be supported by properly cited research.
												</p>
											<header class="major">
												<h3>Collaborative Discussion One</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												Discussion topic one, "Increasing cyber security investment in the energy industry",  
												was peer reviewed by two class members, followed by my response below.<br>
												<a href="static/LCYS/LCYS-CLD1-InitialPost.pdf" class="button">Review Post</a>
											</p>

											<p>The discussion topic, “Increasing cyber security investment in the energy industry”, was intended to highlight
											the need for ICS cyber security investment due to the potential for societal impact. Peer reviewer Steven Johnson 
											contributed very qualified feedback, confirming the lack of military assistance, and identifying solutions offered by CISA.</p>
											<p>The current CISA offerings are related to cyber security response preparedness, risk assessment and specialist assistance when incident response is required (CISA.gov, 2021). While such offerings will accelerate an organization’s ICS cyber security program, the government agency stops short of supporting solution implementation.</p>
											<p>Response capabilities are the fourth of five high level functions defined in the NIST Cyber Security Framework (CSF), asset identification and protection being the first two (NIST, 2020).  NIST CSF states functions do need to be applied in a particular order; that said, certain activity categories are effectively prerequisite to completing other functions.  For example, identifying assets, communication flows and known vulnerabilities within an ICS system is required before an accurate risk assessment can be completed.</p>
											<p>Although CISA provides free information and software (CISA.gov, 2021), the expertise required to collect and analyze the organization’s ICS environment is an expense borne by the ICS operator.  An in-depth legal paper on cyber security investment incentives, cited by peer reviewer Shota Kameyama, noted only larger companies are likely to have dedicated cyber security staff due to cost (Kosseff, 2016). Reviewing tax credit research has identified long term job creation is not assured because tax credits often disappear with policy changes (Bowden, 2013). Retraining grants would allow ICS operators to retain employees with years of field experience and meet the demand for cyber skills without competing in the open market for talent (Maurer & Nelson, 2020) while simultaneously advancing competitiveness through increased digitization. Grant costs may be justifiable when weighed against the social impact of insecure critical infrastructure.</p>

												<h3>Collaborative Discussion Two</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												Discussion topic two, "Moving beyond firewalls",  
												was peer reviewed by three class members, followed by my response below.<br>
												<a href="static/LCYS/LCYS-CLD2-InitalPost.pdf" class="button">Review Post</a>
											</p>

											<p>
												The first sentence of the original post underscored the need to prioritize security technology investments that protect the user’s account and computing platform since many workers are not always protected by the corporate firewall. The pandemic driven requirement for remote working at scale proved not only feasibility, it also identified cost saving options (Gartner, 2020) and many workers actually prefer it (McCabe, 2020). 
											</p>
											<p>
												Authentication is often the first control that must be satisfied before granting access to any information technology system. Consequently I initially recommended, and still maintain, enhancing this protection mechanism reduces the risk of unauthorized access to an organization’s applications and data in a cost-effective manner. This claim is further supported by additional research I was able to locate separate studies by Microsoft and Google, both reporting greater than 99% reduction in account compromises once multi-factor authentication (MFA) is implemented (Maynes, 2019; Thomas & Moscicki, 2019). Post reviewer Nasim Akbary correctly identified MFA can be implemented through various technologies (Akbary, 2021), raising a question about two common MFA implementations over cellular phone which has both security and economic aspects for consideration.
											</p>
											<p>
												Although mobile access is nearly ubiquitous across the globe, smartphone adoption still lags conventional mobile penetration (PEW Research Center, 2021)  so organizational goals should dictate the MFA choice. One-time codes delivered to a user via short messaging service (SMS) are less convenient than a smartphone application but allow a wider number of users to safely authenticate. When an organization can be assured authorized users will have access to smartphone technology MFA notification applications are more convenient and provide a slight increase in prevention against targeted attacks (Thomas & Moscicki, 2019).
											</p>
											<p>
												Multiple commercial software as a service (SaaS) options are now available to reduce cost and complexity of implementing MFA, placing this technology within the reach of small and medium organizations (Cisco, 2021). Conversely a top tier endpoint detection and response (EDR) product such as Crowdstrike can easily exceed several hundred thousand dollars for a larger organization (Cybersecurity Pricing, 2021), therefore it is not a solution every organization will be able to fund. The high cost of EDR was the impetus for recommending a reduction in network firewall investment as cost balancing measure. The original post did not clarify investment reduction should come through purchasing only firewall capabilities that are needed (Kelley, 2014), not a recommendation for removing firewalls altogether.

												<h3>Reflections on Collaborative discussions</h3>
											</header>
												<p>Both collaborative discussions appear to be exposing students to cyber security components and the ramifications
													of implementing those components, aligning with one of he module's learning objectives. In theory, civil discourse amongst peers serves to educate all parties since the 
													response process required citations supporting any position rather than simply stating an opinion.
												</p>
												<p> My professional cyber security roles have required both technical and written work that includes recommendations, 
												but presenting suitable research related to the discussion and being willing to
												search for alternative points of view was a personal challenge. The first peer review process also demonstrated the value 
													of peer discourse, fellow students did not hesitate to bring points forward for my consideration. In particular, 
													the question regarding the effectiveness of tax credits forced me to not only research the topic specifically looking for measures of effectiveness but also consider alternative
													approaches to solve the workforce skills issue I still contend requires much more investment. 
												</p>
												<p>Unfortunately, I did not feel the same level of of engaged discussion with my cohort
													on the second collaborative discussion. The assignment had listed firewalls
													as a possible technology for consideration and the class had recently covered firewalls in a seminar on security controls and
													most students only discussed firewalls as a security control. 
													Learning in a later module very few students had extensive cybersecurity experience, they may
													have been influenced to lead with that technology solution without any practical understanding of the limitations
													of this control mechanism. Since my position challenged the 
													return on investment for modern enterprise firewalls, I recieved only one question on my position regarding multifactor 
													authentication and there was no discourse regarding the limited effectiveness of firewalls.
													While network protection will always be a manadatory requirement, the inability to reliably 
													inspect application layer attacks due to TLS encryption and the amazing levels of 
													obfuscation present in modern fileless malware leaves me unconvinced that firewall
													investment should remain the priority. I now consider network based prevention 
													table stakes, not a cornerstone of the defence strategy.

												<h3>Vulnerability identification and mitigation</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Since identifying security controls for the medical scheduling application was part of the case study assignment,
												module units included exposure to UML modeling and secure system design principles to assist skill development in this areas. Two formative artifacts were
												asked of the students, a <a href="static/LCYS/LCYS-Unit-4_Threat-Modeling.pdf">wiki post on HTTP application threats</a> and <a href="static/LCYS/LCSY-unit5-UML_diagrams.pdf"> UML modeling digrams </a>to illustrate threats.
											</p>
											<p> The following summary was prepared for a seminar discussion related to vulnerabilites within http-based applications. 
												Despite having performed numerous web application security tests professionally over the years I did take the time to locate
												multiple references so others in my cohort could do their own research if unfamiliar with web application testing 
												and support my comments, (listed below), in the seminar.    
												<ul>
													<li>The NIST Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF) defines the steps a software producer should take to ensure security is included in the development process and is abstracted enough that it can be applied to popular development models like agile and waterfall while simultaneously being suitable for software created for any industry (NIST, 2020). The NIST SSDF lists threat modeling as a requirement for an organization to produce well-secured software, stopping short of defining a specific approach, links to more detailed resources are included (NIST, 2020).</li>
													<li>The Open Web Application Standard Project (OWASP) has been promoting secure code development for HTTP based applications for more than fifteen years. Similar to other threat modeling guidance it is incumbent on the organization creating the application to identify high impact, high likelihood events that warrant mitigation (OWASP, n.d.).</li>
													<li>Table-top discussions can be used to validate the viability of certain types of threat scenarios (Veatch, et al., 1999) , which can ensure those that know the organization best can best assess the likelihood of a specific threat having an impact on the organization. Table-tops that are focused on organizational impacts can include members of the organization outside of the I.T. department such as legal, plant operations and finance.  Scenario based threat model development is dependent on the input of domain experts, limiting the view of risks to purely technical elements can result in mitigations implemented that have little value and other risks being overlooked.</li>
													<li>Attack trees or threat trees are another approach to identifying threats, while more technical in nature due to the requirement to deconstruct the adversarial goal into a series of steps the path variations can result in hundreds of scenarios for consideration (Widel, et al., 2019). Like table-tops, an attack tree based threat modeling activity will depend on individuals to identify likelihood and impact.</li>
												</ul>
											</p>
											<h4>Reflection</h4>
											<p>
												These concepts are complex and would be revisited in later modules so only high level explanations were given in the seminars due to the limited time available.
												Students unfamiliar with cybersecurity could have found this portion of the module would not adequately support the analysis required to identify credible threats
												to the proposed application and mitigating controls. While the Essex module home identifies the potential need for <a href="https://www.my-course.co.uk/course/view.php?id=6698&section=0">
													 additional programing study</a>, students with limited exposure to cybersecurity may not identify, even through reading, 
													 the gaps in their knowledge that require further exploration to provide comprehensive analysis (Young& Ley, 2000). I found the exposure to UML as an 
													 illlustrative approach was informative but the attack defense tree mmodeling taught in a subesequent module provides a more measureable means of
													 defending control decisions. Ironically my question about the use of attack trees was dismissed by the professor as seldom used yet it was a summative
													assignment in a later module.

											<h3>Reflection</h3>
												<p>Writing assignments are expected in university, what I was not prepared for was the level of
													ambiguity within the instructions. Fortunately there was an opportunity to present an outline
													of the report and receive email feedback prior to completing the work. I personally found I required
													an office hours meeting with my professor to fully clarify what was required, the emailed responses
													did not really clear up the confusion the way a short conversation did. This experience is not unlike cyber security consulting in the real world, statements of work and requests for
													poposals are often open ended and negotiation regarding final project deliverables is not uncommon.

											<h3>Case Study Reflection</h3>
										</header>
										<p> The 
										</p>
										
											<p>Writing the report took far more time than the nine hours indicated as recommended study hours and the 2000
												word constraint really limited the level of description possilbe for a solution report. That said, the limitation
												does force the cyber security person to be very selective in what is communicated to the customer. This is not
												an unreasonable requirement, from my experience in the field lengthy reports are seldom read. 
												The challenge I have observed in my professional practice is shorter reports with summary tables 
												and high level descriptions lack the detailed analysis needed to define requirements for remediation of cyber security issues. 
												This dilema was reflected in the professor's feedback regarding mitigation of insider threat concerns (see below). 
												 
											</p>
											<h4> Feedback Snippet</h4>
											<p>"...it is unclear how the elevation of privilege threat within the system will be addressed 
												– ie how do we ensure a non-clinical staff is unable to view clinical report?" </p>
											<h4> Controls Identified In Report </h4>
											<p>
												Patient database security permissions are restricted to the dedicated account used by business logic 
												application functions and the database commands needed for those functions (OWASP Foundation, 2021). 
												Connection credentials used by an application entity must be instantiated at runtime, not stored 
												in code (Engel, 2020). These measures minimize the consequences of an attacker gaining access to the 
												business logic server, -- STRIDE threat category Elevation of Privilege --, then making a direct patient
												connection to retrieve all records. <br>
												The final trust boundary is STRIDE Information Disclosure threats from internal attackers. Administrative 
												controls will be required to determine whether patient record access was authorized (Adler, 2019) since
												employees and consultants must view patient data through ASMIS. IT administrative access risks can be 
												mitigated through products like transparent data encryption (TDE) (Oracle, 2021; Microsoft, 2021) to 
												protect data at rest.
											</p>
											<p>
												The insider threat was arguably had the lowest likelyhood of all threats identified in the report and corespondingly reflected in words allocated. 
												While the database controls can provide an effective mitigation for both internal users and external clients since all
												parties use the same application, there was specific explanation of that concept due to word count limitations and the stated
												assumption that the report was directed to the organizations senior and I.T. management who possess a functional understanding of
												business management systems and issues. Highlighting the compensating administrative control due to the limited technical enforcement capability,
												seemed like a more direct linkage to insider threat concerns but since the controls were aligned to STRIDE catagories the messages were seperated
												by a couple paragraphs, potentially making the linkage less obvious. I anticipate I will need to continue to refine my communication skills 
												through writing assignments in later modules and draw very clear lines to any items mentioned in a marking guide. 
										  	</p>
										  <p>Although the programming assignment specified implementing one solution identifed in the report, I was encouraged,during office hours with my professor, 
											  to include a number of security controls in the program while remaining within the constraints of a single Python file.  Consequently I used procedural 
											  approach encompasing a while loop and several functions to demonstrate the various roles that would be implemented in the application, preventative controls
											  applied and reduce code complexity. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the critique,specifically regarding the lack of python classes being used 
											  despite the fact that many in the Python development community consider classes an inappropriate solution in many cases (Cannon, 2017), and the assignment
											  was a single Python file demonstrating a single function, not a fulsom application with user registration, password reset and so forth. <br>
											  What I can take away from this is people have different mental models and there will be times in the security field that my customer's description or 
											  understanding of the requirements and mine will differ despite attempts on both sides to clarify understanding. I have recently been adding more books on
											  management communications to my reading routine to help resolve these disconnects.
